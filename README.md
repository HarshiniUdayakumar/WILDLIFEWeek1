This project utilizes TensorFlow and MobileNetV2 to classify images into 90 different animal categories. Using a pre-trained deep learning model, it leverages transfer learning to efficiently recognize animal species. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the model is trained with GPU acceleration for faster performance. The repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation, along with visualization tools to explore the dataset. Future improvements aim to enhance accuracy through data augmentation and UI integration for real-time classification."
